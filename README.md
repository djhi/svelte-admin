# svelte-admin

An experiment (for now) to build an equivalent of [react-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin) for svelte.

The current version is deployed automatically via Vercel at this address:

[https://svelte-admin-seven.vercel.app/](https://svelte-admin-seven.vercel.app/)

This is currently a single repository with a single application, not a library.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Have the basic core features implemented
- [ ] Refactor as a monorepo with multiple libraries and an example application

## Contribute

You can look for issues labelled with _Help Wanted_ if you want to contribute.

Simply clone the repository and install the dependencies with `yarn` (for now).

Run `yarn dev` to start the example app.
Run `yarn build` to ensure everything compiles.
Run `yarn build && yarn preview` to compile and play with the production application.
